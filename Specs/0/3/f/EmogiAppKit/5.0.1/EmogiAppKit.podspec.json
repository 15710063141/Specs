  "description": "A great messaging experience is about more than chat. Weâ€™ve developed an SDK that incorporates best practices developed from our extensive testing and analysis of how people chat with each other. The SDK has an out-of-the-box UI that lets you offer a fun, engaging and enjoyable chat experience without extensive development. For an overview of the critical user interaction and design patterns that come included in our UI, check out our User Experience Guidelines.",
